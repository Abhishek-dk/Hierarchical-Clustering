# Hierarchical-Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm, 
which is used to group the unlabeled datasets into a cluster and also known as hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA.

In this algorithm, we develop the hierarchy of clusters in the form of a tree, and this tree-shaped structure is known as the dendrogram.
